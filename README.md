## Statistical question
Does a passenger's `Sex` have an impact on their chance of `Survival`?

## Hypotheses

H<sub>0</sub>: Any difference between male passenger survival rate and
 female passenger survival rate is caused by chance.

H<sub>1</sub>: Any difference between male passenger survival rate and
 female passenger survival rate is not caused by chance, but is 
actually statistically significant.

## Better hypothesis formulation

H<sub>0</sub>:  The variables `Sex` and `Survival` are independent.
They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion 
of males and females who survived the sinking of the Titanic (55.31%) 
was due to chance.

H<sub>1</sub>: The variables `Sex` and `Survival` are not independent.
The difference in survival rates of 55.31% was not due to chance,
and sex does help predict survival.
